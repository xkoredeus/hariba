            <h5 class="page__subtitle">The famous Fresnel lens</h5>
            <p>During the course of the 18th century, European nations built up vast colonial empires trading in sugar, coffee and cocoa beans from the Americas, tea, spices and silk from Asia, and manufactured products from Europe. This trade fueled the development of Europe’s Atlantic seaboard, making the effectiveness of lighthouses a matter of some importance to safety at sea. In June 1819, François Arago, an astronomer, physicist and man of state, put forward the name of Augustin Fresnel, the great discoverer of the wave theory of light, to France’s Lighthouse Commission. Fresnel was subsequently tasked with improving lighthouses in the English Channel and Atlantic. Some months later, he came up with a design for a stepped lens able to produce a much more powerful beam to light the seas. He asked Jean-Baptiste François Soleil, an optical engineer whose name—soleil means ‘sun’ in French—seemingly predestined him for what would follow, to fabricate this lens. So began an industrial and human adventure that is still continuing 200 years later through HORIBA France SAS and Jobin Yvon, whose reputation in the world of science persists to this day</p>
